						<h4>Contract Law</h4>
						<p>
							A good contract clearly defines the rights and obligations of the parties and provides a 
							means by which its terms can be enforced. It is therefore necessary that care be taken 
							in the drafting of a contract or that advice be obtained at an early stage to ensure 
							that the contract achieves these objectives.

						<br><br>
						<h4>Employment Law</h4>
						
						<p>
							Finding yourself in a position where you feel as though you’ve been wrongfully terminated or unfairly treated by an employer is never easy. 
							We aim to focus on the duties owed to you, whether there is a breach of that duty and if there are any available remedies.
